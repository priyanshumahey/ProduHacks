# Node Template for gpt-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT model) API ðŸ¤–

This quick guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating a Node.js server that sends requests to the ChatGPT API to generate responses for your chatbot.

For more information about how the API works and fine-tuning for specific cases, please refer to [OpenAI's official documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction)

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Node.js
- Node.js (at least version 14.x)
- An [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) for authentication purposes

## Setup

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/FrancescoCoding/easyGPT.git
```

Navigate to the newly created directory:

```
cd easyGPT
cd node_server
```

Open the terminal in that folder and install the dependencies using the following command:

```
npm install
```

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following line:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Running the server

```
npm start
```

The server should now be running on http://localhost:3000. You can test the server by sending a POST request to http://localhost:3000/askgpt with the following JSON body:

```
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hello ChatGPT!"
        }
    ]
```

Replace "Hello, ChatGPT!" with your own message.

The response should contain the generated text from the ChatGPT API:

```
{
    "answer": "Hello Francesco! Nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?"
}
```

You can also find the Postman collection for the request in this repository

Awesome, you have successfully set up a server that can communicate with the ChatGPT API and generate responses for your chatbot.

This server can be used as a starting point for building your own chatbot or integrating ChatGPT into an existing chatbot. With a few modifications, you can customize the server to suit your specific needs and requirements.
